Hi [BOSS],
As you know, I love it here. Our team is solid and I really enjoy collaborating with them. 
I feel lucky to get to work on projects like [PROJECT] for [CLIENT] and [PROJECT] for [CLIENT]. 
Being able to add my skills and knowledge to the mix of all the talented people here at the agency makes it really exciting for me to come to work every day.

I have no desire to work anywhere else, but lately I have been getting lots of recruiters and people I know at other companies reaching out to me to see if I'd be interested in making a move. 
I turn them down of course, but in doing some research, I see that the average salary for web developers in [CITY] is about 5% higher than what I am currently making. 
I certainly consider myself above average, and I hope you agree.

Please get back to me when you have some time so we can discuss further.
Thanks!
