Hi everyone,

my name is Thanh Lai, this is Aaron Liu.
We are developers from North49 Business Solutions.

We are here today to talk about our implementation of an old Sage module that we have successfully converted into a
web application using the new Sage 300 SDK.

To begin with, I will show you what the old product is and what it does

it is a dashboard that displaying an overview of orders which meet specific search criteria and providing several custom actions for the selected orders.

as I mentioned earlier, the goal of this experiment is to convert the current Order Control desktop application to the web-based application


So here is the application
simple enough, getting search criteria to display approriate orders

During and after development, we have learned that, the new Sage SDK is pretty good.
Easy to integrate and implement (MVC pattern).
Web services (RESTful API) support - meaning - lots of possibilities for extensions.
Code Generation - less typing, happy developer
AWESOME technical help - Stephen Smith's Blog & John Thomas.

Beside the good parts,
here are some struggles we have personally
I have to rewrite the application 3 times
first time was my development doesn't have the new SDK installed, messup assembly dlls, missing files, blow up
second time was the naming conversion issue I have, notice that you should not name the module which happens to be one of the reserved Sage module
for example OE, AR, IC

second challenge is code generation - as I mentioned cg is good, but everything has 2 sides, this may be too much magic for beginners or non-webdevelopers to swallow

Lastly, hard to convince your boss to buy Kendo UI license.
